/**
 * legacy-npc.ts — NPC entity system for the Niakofa Legacy walking world.
 *
 * Architecture drawn from:
 *   • Eldiron/crates/rusterix/src/server/entity.rs — entity with position,
 *     facing, health, behavior state; time-of-day schedule; pathfinding
 *   • MMOCore social + relationship events as design reference (not code)
 *
 * Each NPC has:
 *   1. Static definition  (NPCDefinition) — who they are, their schedule
 *   2. Runtime state      (NPCState)      — where they are right now
 *   3. Controller         (NPCController) — tick() drives the state machine
 *
 * NPCs know what time period is active (dawn/morning/afternoon/evening/night)
 * and change their goal tile based on their schedule. They walk toward the
 * goal tile using simple direct-approach pathfinding (Eldiron grid pattern).
 * When the player is adjacent they surface an interaction prompt.
 *
 * All rendering is done externally (caller draws an annotated PIXI.Graphics
 * or ActorSprite at state.x, state.y until full sprite sheets ship).
