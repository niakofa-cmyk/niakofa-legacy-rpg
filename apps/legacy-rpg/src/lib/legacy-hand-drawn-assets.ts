/**
 * Extension of legacy-character-engine.ts's asset registry with an
 * enforced hand-drawn-art requirement for protagonist/antagonist roles.
 *
 * This file is additive: it does not replace legacy-character-engine.ts,
 * it wraps it. Every currently-registered RPG-Maker-style asset becomes
 * `artTier: "prototypePixel"` and stays valid for background NPCs and
 * internal prototyping — it is simply no longer eligible for Kwame, any
 * playable ancestor, or any named antagonist.
 *
 * Family facts still stay in the vault. This module resolves a visual
 * runtime representation only, and never infers identity, history, or
 * gender — same boundary the base engine already documents.
